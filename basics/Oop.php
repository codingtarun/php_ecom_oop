/**
 * 
 * Different types of programming paradigms we can use in PHP : 
 * 1. Procedural 
 * 2. Functional
 * 3. Object-Oriented
 * 
 * 
 * 1. Procedural : A program is subdivided into functions
 * 
 * 2. Functional : Focus on creating application with functions and functions are treated as first-class citizens. 
 *                 Functions as first-class citizens : functions are treated as other data type.
 *                  i.e we can store function is a variable.
 *                      we can pass a function as argument to other functions.
 *                      function can be returned from a function
 * 
 * 3. Object Oriented programming : Concerns are seperated into objects and each objec can contain properties and methods that can be performed by the object.
